CS431 Household Manager Application

The way we split up the work for this project
was a simple frontend/backend split.

Kenny and Grace worked on the frontend while
Tyler and Alejandro worked on the backend.

Throughout the project we used github to collaborate.

Starting the Frontend Server:
Required Packages:
- Node - https://nodejs.org/en/download
- NPM - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Steps to Run Frontend on LocalHost:
1. cd to src/main/ui
2. run `npm install` 
3. run `npm run start`
4. The client will be available at: http://localhost:3000/ if the port is not taken.
